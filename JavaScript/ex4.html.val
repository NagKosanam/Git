   1: <html>
------|

[CSE] Warning number 1 in line 1:1:
[24] A document type declaration should appear as the first
line (line 1) of every HTML document. For example, for HTML5
documents use <!DOCTYPE html>. For HTML 4.01 Strict
documents use <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML
4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">. For HTML
4.01 Transitional documents, use <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC
"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">. Although HTML
recommendations generally require this line, most browsers
probably ignore it. If you're using HTML Validator's
integrated editor, then this can be added from the 'Tags'
menu or from the HTML Inserter.

   1: <html>
------|

[CSE] Warning number 2 in line 1:1:
Not using a DOCTYPE will likely trigger quirks mode in
browsers. If possible, quirks mode should be avoided in
favor of standards mode. Visit
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirks_mode for more
information about quirks mode. Note that the recommended
DOCTYPE to use now is HTML5, which is simply <!DOCTYPE
html>.

   1: <html>
-------||||

[CSE] Warning number 3 in line 1:2:
The natural primary language is not specified. It is highly
recommended that the "lang" and/or "xml:lang" (for XHTML)
attributes be used with the "html" element to specify the
primary language. For example, add the attribute lang="en"
for English or lang="fr" for French. Specifying the language
assists braille translation software, speech synthesizers,
translation software, and has other benefits.

   2: <head>
-------||||

[CSE] Warning number 4 in line 2:2:
[32] No title was found. In most situations, the document
should be given a title by using the "title" element in the
document's "head" section. HTML 4.01 and XHTML require
exactly one "title" element for each document. Note that
HTML5+ allows the "title" element to be omitted when the
title is provided by a higher-level protocol, like the
subject line of an e-mail message when HTML is used as the
email format, or when the document is an "iframe srcdoc"
document.

   2: <head>
-------||||

[CSE] Warning number 5 in line 2:2:
No title was found in this "head" section. Each page on a
site should have its own unique (never duplicated) title.
Every title should contain appropriate keywords and search
terms that are relevant to the page. Don't just stuff
keywords in the title. The first words in the title are more
likely to result in higher rankings than subsequent words,
so use important keywords at the very beginning when
reasonable. The title should also be something that a user
will want to click on when it's listed on a search engine. A
good title is also important when a visitor bookmarks a
page.

   2: <head>
-------||||

[CSE] Message number 1 in line 2:2:
A meta tag specifying the charset encoding was not found
within this document's "head" section. This could pose a
problem if the document is served locally or not served via
HTTP with an HTTP header that specifies the encoding.
Consider specifying the encoding in a meta tag. An example
"meta" tag for HTML5 documents is (if possible, place this
immediately after the "head" start-tag): <meta
charset="utf-8">

   3: <script type="text/javascript">
-------||||||

[CSE] Message number 2 in line 3:2:
Avoid placing scripts (especially longer ones) in the head
section if possible. Doing this can make the page seem
slower to load because the browser must pause to download
(if using the "src" attribute) and run the script. Also, DOM
content is not loaded yet so it is not available to the
script. In most cases it's best to place scripts right
before the </body> end tag. This message is displayed only
once.

   3: <script type="text/javascript">
--------------------|||||||||||||||

[CSE] Message number 3 in line 3:15:
Although "text/javascript" is not technically correct, it is
widely supported and is therefore recommended. The
technically correct Internet media type (MIME type)
"application/javascript" is not as widely supported (IE8
does not recognize it), but some may want to consider
configuring their server to serve JavaScript files with the
technically correct media type while still using
text="text/javascript" with "script" elements. This message
is displayed only once.

   4:   // hard-coded inside the function.
--------|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

[CSE] Message number 4 in line 4:3:
If possible, keep scripts in separate files and avoid
embedding scripts directly in pages (inline scripts).
Instead, use the "src" attribute to specify an external
script document. Using external script documents is better
style and also has other benefits. This message is displayed
only once.

[CSE] Message number 5 in line 35:15:
No option in this "select" element was selected using the

it is recommended that an "option" element use the

[CSE] Message number 6 in line 42:2:
Ensure that the "br" element is used only for line breaks
that are actually part of the content, as in poems or
addresses. For presentational formatting, CSS should be
used. This message is displayed only once.

[CSE] Comment number 1:
Beginner mode is on. This mode may reduce the number of
validator messages and make other changes to make this
program easier to use, but less powerful. To toggle this
mode, please choose 'Options->Beginner Mode' in the editor.
See the getting started documentation (Help->Getting
Started) for more information.

[73] Section 508 accessibility checking is off.

[CSE] Comment number 3:
[73] WCAG 1.0 accessibility checking is off.

[CSE] Comment number 4:
[73] WCAG 2.0 accessibility checking is off.

[CSE] Comment number 5:
Accessibility checking is off. This program can help you
make your web pages more accessible. An accessible page is
one that more individuals can use, such as individuals who
are blind or deaf. It can also increase the usefulness of
your web page for individuals who browse the web using
slower devices like older computers or wireless devices like
mobile phones and PDAs. An accessible web site makes good
business sense (and possibly good legal sense as well) and
may even improve search engine rankings. You can enable or
disable accessibility checking in the Validator Engine
Options.

[CSE] Comment number 6:
This is an unregistered, evaluation version of CSE HTML
Validator Professional which has validated 105 documents.
Please note that only 95 more documents can be validated
before the evaluation expires.

Keyword density: select (5x - 12.5%), Selection (5x -
12.5%), Val1 (5x - 12.5%), Val2 (5x - 12.5%), Val3 (5x -

(1x - 2.5%), 4 (1x - 2.5%), 5 (1x - 2.5%). Remember: Don't
write SEO optimized content. Write for people, which is what
search engines want. Complete list. 5 words excluded.

[CSE] Comment number 8:
HTML document detected.

[CSE] Comment number 9:
[133] Mobility Tip #10 - Avoid fixed widths and absolute
units (like "px") in favor of relative widths (like percents
and "em") wherever possible.

[CSE] Comment number 10:
<meta name="description" content="(actual description)">
should be used in the "head" section to provide a brief
description of what is contained on this page. Although
descriptions may not be used directly for rankings, search
engines may display descriptions in search results, with
bolding of the relevent keywords. Therefore, a good
description can help boost click-through rates and thus
increase traffic to a website. If you're using HTML
Validator's integrated editor, then this can be added from
the 'Tags' menu or from the HTML Inserter.

[CSE] Comment number 11:
Consider using <meta name="keywords" content="(actual
keyword list)"> in the "head" section to provide a list of
keywords that are relevant to this page. This information is
still being used by a few (less popular) search engines, so
it may bring a few extra visitors to your site. However, we
recommend that you not spend too much time on it. If you're
using HTML Validator's integrated editor, then this can be
added from the 'Tags' menu or from the HTML Inserter.

[CSE] Comment number 12:
No "h1" or "h2" heading element was found. Using these
heading elments (especially "h1" and preferably with your
best keywords) to describe sub-topics of a page may improve
search engine rankings. If "h1" text is too large then you
can reduce its size with CSS.

[CSE] Comment number 13:
No italicizing, emphasizing, bolding, or strong tags were
used. Emphasizing or italicizing keywords (with the "em"
element) may improve rankings. Similarly, using strong text
or bolding keywords (with the "strong" element) may also
improve rankings.

[CSE] Comment number 14:
[113] Random Search Engine Tip #12 - USE THE "TITLE"
ATTRIBUTE. Many elements support the "title" attribute that
is used for annotation (do not confuse the "title" element
with the "title" attribute). Consider annotating tags like
"a" with something like title="Read about <keywords>".
Annotate with keywords and search terms. Some browsers, like
Firefox, will also display the value of the "title"
attribute when the user hovers the mouse over content with a
"title" attribute.

[CSE] Comment number 15:
[10] CSE HTML Validator (standard or higher) allows you to
disable certain messages (like this example message) and
groups of related messages by disabling flags. For example,
the [10] at the beginning of this message indicates that
this message can be disabled by disabling validator flag 10.
If you are using HTML Validator's integrated editor, then
you can use your mouse on this message to open the context
menu (usually done by right-clicking the mouse on this
message) and selecting 'Message Options->Disable Flag 10' to
disable this message. For more information about disabling
messages, see the 'Disabling Validator Messages' topic in
the documentation.

[CSE] Comment number 16:
CSE HTML Validator (standard or higher) allows you to
disable many messages on an individual basis without using
flags. For instance, you can disable this message by using
HTML Validator's integrated editor to open the context menu
for this message (usually done by right-clicking the mouse
on this message) and selecting 'Message Options->Disable
using Message ID' or 'Message Options->Disable using Exact
Text Match' to disable this message. For more information
about disabling messages, see the 'Disabling Validator
Messages' topic in the documentation.
